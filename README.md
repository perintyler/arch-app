# Arch App

Arch app was iOS app written in swift. Users could create events at our partnered venues and then receive tiered discounts and promotions for food/drinks. As more people attend an event, better discounts/promotions were offered, and an eventâ€™s attendance rates was determined using user location services. Users were authenticated with Firebase. The back-end was hosted on AWS and consisted of a Postgres database and a Django-REST API.

## Venue Tab

Users could scroll through our partnered venues on the `Venue Tab` to browse the latest offers/promotions. Selecting a venue would open the `VenueView`, which allowed our users to create an event, invite their friends to the event, and recieve discounts and/or free food/drink.

## Activity Feed

The `Stream` tab (`Activity Feed` is probably a more fitting name in retrospect) displayed the venues that the user's Facebook friends were going to on a given night.
